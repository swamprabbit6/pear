This project is a daily planner that displays the current day at the top of the calendar. The planner allows a user to scroll through business hour time blocks that are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or the future. The planner allows a user to save events to time blocks that persist in the users local storage even when the page is refreshed.
